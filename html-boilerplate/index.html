        <p>This is going to be the first paragraph of this webpage. Also there is apparently 6 different heading elements, not just 5.</p>
        <p>This is going to be the second paragraph of this webpage and is so much cooler than the first one.</p>

        <p><strong>Strong</strong> tags are used to bold text and signify to <strong>screen readers</strong> and other <strong>assistive</strong> technologies of important data in the webpage.</p>

        <p>Another element to <em>emphasize</em> important text in a webpage is to use the <em>emphasis</em> tag. Duh...</p>

        <p>All of this text are the child elements to the body tag/element. The body tag/element that this text is in, is the child to the html tag/element.</p>

        <p>There is a comment in this paragraph block. <!-- I'm just a lonely comment --> Can you find it? (Inspect the page!)</p>
